# emoji-to-text
Convert unicode emojis included in a given text, to their translated emoji description.

This basic app includes the EmojiToText class that you can call as simple as:

  String translated_text = EmojiToText.translateEmoji(context, input_text);

We are building the translations for all the emoji, current and to come, but not only emoji to English text, but to all the possible languages. And that's why we created a web portal (IN PROGRESS, WILL UPDATE SOON WITH THE LINK) to help the cooperation in the translation of the emojis to be the reference project when working with emojis. In the meantime, you can help us translating the XML directly. Contact us at translations@codefactoryglobal.com and we will let you know if there is somebody working on it already!

Where this come from? Having the translation of emoji may be very helpful in many situations, but if we think on accessibility it gets really important, as the only way for many people to know what's behind a funny image.
